## Summary

This file was dropped into the Zoya vault inbox as `demo_contract.md` and queued for processing on 2026-02-18. The file metadata is present but the document body contains no readable contract content — only the system queue notice "New file dropped for processing." This appears to be a test or placeholder file used to validate the inbox-processor pipeline.

## Action Items

- [ ] Verify whether the original contract content was intended to be included in this file
- [ ] Re-drop the file with full contract body if this was a pipeline test gone wrong
- [ ] Manual review recommended to confirm no contract terms were lost

## Category

Categorized as `contract` based on the filename (`demo_contract.md`); however, no contract body was found in the document — manual review required to confirm content and any associated deadlines or signatories.
