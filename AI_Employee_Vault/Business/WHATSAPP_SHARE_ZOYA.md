# WhatsApp Message: Zoya AI Employee Launch

## Message Content

🤖 **Zoya: Your Personal AI Employee**

Just launched something I've been building for months — an AI that runs on my laptop and actually manages my business.

**What it does:**
• Reads & processes documents (invoices, contracts, emails)
• Posts to LinkedIn & Twitter (with my approval)
• Monitors WhatsApp for business messages
• Generates daily briefings
• Self-monitors for problems
• Keeps complete audit trail

**Key numbers:**
✅ 60+ documents processed
✅ 3 data sources integrated
✅ 100% success rate
✅ Zero cloud required

Built with:
- Claude Code (reasoning)
- Python (orchestration)
- Obsidian (memory)

Open source architecture. Local first. Human-in-the-loop approval for everything important.

The future of personal AI isn't fancy dashboards—it's solid architecture.
