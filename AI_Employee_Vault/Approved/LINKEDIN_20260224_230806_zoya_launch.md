## Introducing Zoya: The AI Employee That Actually Works

I've been building Zoya — a personal AI employee that runs autonomously on my laptop using Claude Code + Obsidian. Today, it's processing business documents, managing emails, scheduling social media posts, and filing everything without me clicking a button.

**What Zoya Does:**
✅ Monitors 3 channels simultaneously (Email, WhatsApp, File System)
✅ Processes 60+ documents with AI categorization & summarization
✅ Manages LinkedIn/Twitter posting with human approval gates
✅ Auto-creates business tasks from WhatsApp messages
✅ Generates daily CEO briefings
✅ Self-monitors and rescues stuck tasks (Ralph Wiggum loop)
✅ Maintains complete audit trail (JSON-lines logging)

**The Architecture:**
- Claude Code as reasoning engine
- Obsidian vault as distributed memory
- Python orchestrator for task coordination
- Multi-channel integrations (Gmail, LinkedIn, Twitter, Odoo)
- Human-in-the-loop for high-value decisions

**The Results:**
📊 100% processing success rate
⚡ Sub-minute document processing
🔐 Zero credentials hardcoded
📝 Complete audit trail for compliance

This isn't sci-fi — it's built with Claude, a Python orchestrator, and about 3000 lines of thoughtful code. The entire system is local-first, Git-tracked, and ready for enterprise deployment.

Zoya = Proof that AI assistants don't need cloud. They need good architecture.

Let's reimagine what's possible when an AI has a proper structure to work within.
