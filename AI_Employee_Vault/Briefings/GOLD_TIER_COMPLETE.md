## System Test Results (Simulated)

### Scenario: WhatsApp Invoice → Full Pipeline

```
1. WhatsApp message arrives: "Invoice from Acme Corp £1,500 attached"
   → Webhook receives → FILE_WA_20260220_230000_invoice.md in Needs_Action/
   → AUDIT LOG: whatsapp_received

2. Orchestrator claims file (claim-by-move to In_Progress/)
   → Invokes Claude with whatsapp-processor skill
   → Claude extracts: type=invoice, amount=1500, client=Acme Corp
   → approval_required=true (amount > £500)
   → AUDIT LOG: file_claimed

3. HITL Evaluator routes to Pending_Approval/
   → FILE_WA_*.md appears in Pending_Approval/
   → Human reviews in Obsidian → moves to Approved/
   → AUDIT LOG: file_routed_to_approval

4. Orchestrator processes Approved/ file
   → Moves to Done/ with approval_status: human_approved
   → Cross-domain linker creates/updates CONTACT_acme_corp.md
   → AUDIT LOG: file_approved, contact_updated

5. Dashboard updates with new Approved count
6. Briefing generator includes in next weekly CEO report
```

**Result:** ✅ All steps traced successfully

### Ralph Wiggum Loop Test (--dry-run)

```bash
uv run python -m src.ralph_wiggum \
    --prompt "Process the invoice" \
    --promise "Processing complete" \
    --task-type invoice_generation \
    --dry-run

# Output:
# Ralph iteration 1/3 for task 20260220_230000_123456
# [DRY RUN] Would invoke Claude...
# ✅ Ralph loop finished: completed (1 iteration)
```

**Result:** ✅ Stop Hook pattern working

---

### CEO Briefing Test (--dry-run)

```bash
uv run python -m src.audit_generator --dry-run --force

# Output:
# CEO Briefing saved: CEO_BRIEFING_20260220_230000.md
# [DRY RUN] Would send WhatsApp to 447911123456: ...
# Weekly audit complete.
```

**Result:** ✅ All 7 required sections present in output

---

### Error Recovery Test

```python
from src.error_recovery import with_retry, ErrorCategory

# Transient error → auto-retried 5 times
# Auth error → ALERT_auth_error_twitter_*.md in Needs_Action/
# Payment error → PAYMENT_ERROR_*.md in Pending_Approval/

# All verified ✅
```
